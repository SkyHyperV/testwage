What is Testwage?

Testwage is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Testwage uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Testwage Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Testwage Core software, see https://www.testwage.org

Development process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Testwage development team members simply pulls it.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see doc/coding.md) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Testwage.

compiling for debugging

Run configure with the --enable-debug option, then make. Or run configure with CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0" or whatever debug flags you need.

debug.log

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory; error and debugging messages are written there.

The -debug=... command-line option controls debugging; running with just -debug will turn on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes qDebug() output to debug.log under category "qt": run with -debug=qt to see it.
